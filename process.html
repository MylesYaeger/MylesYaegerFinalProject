        <p>
          Each potholder is handcrafted with care, ensuring durability, vibrant
          colors, and perfect functionality. Follow along to see the
          step-by-step process from start to finish.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose Your Materials:</strong> Select your favorite color
            palette and premium cotton loops. We offer a wide range of colors to
            match your kitchen décor and style.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Weaving:</strong> Every potholder is carefully woven by hand
            on a traditional loom. This ensures tight structure and consistency,
            resulting in a soft yet sturdy finish.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finishing Touches:</strong> We add durable stitching around
            the edges and incorporate heat-resistant batting where necessary.
            This guarantees safety and longevity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inspection & Packaging:</strong> Each item undergoes a
            thorough quality check before packaging. Only the best potholders
            make it to your kitchen.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why Handmade Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Handmade potholders not only look beautiful but also offer superior
          quality over mass-produced alternatives. Each loop, stitch, and edge
          is carefully created by artisans who take pride in their work.
          Choosing handmade means supporting craftsmanship and sustainable
          practices.
