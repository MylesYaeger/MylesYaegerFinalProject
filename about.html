        <p>
          Each potholder is woven with care using durable, high-quality
          materials. We believe in craftsmanship that lasts, providing kitchen
          essentials that are both practical and beautiful. We started as a
          small studio in 2020 and have focused on sustainable materials ever
          since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our journey began with a passion for handmade textiles and a desire to
          bring warmth and color to kitchens everywhere. Every piece reflects
          our attention to detail, creativity, and love for functional art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we have grown our studio while keeping our commitment
          to handcrafting each item with care. We carefully source materials,
          support local artisans, and maintain ethical practices in everything
          we do.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Values</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Quality materials</li>
          <li>Responsible sourcing</li>
          <li>Accessible design</li>
          <li>Supporting craftsmanship</li>
          <li>Sustainability and longevity</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Handmade Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Handmade items carry a story. Each potholder is the result of hours of
          skilled work and thoughtful attention. Unlike mass-produced items,
          handmade products have unique character and durability, making them a
          meaningful addition to your kitchen and a gift that will be treasured
          for years.
